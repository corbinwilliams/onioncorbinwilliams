    <p>LANGLEY, VA-A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents - "almost invariably the most crucial passages" - are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's incetion in 1947.</p>
    <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>the Cold War </li>
        <li>the Civil-rights movement </li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>
